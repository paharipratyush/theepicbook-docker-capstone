By focusing on black women, Spillers contends that we get it wrong when we only view slavery through the experience of enslaved people who identified as male.

If dominant society defined black people by their corporeality during slavery, Pinn argues that black religion, which is an experience mediated by and through the black body, constitutes an important site of resistance against oppression. It contains an aesthetic, both in performance and style, that must be more prominently considered by the field of black religious studies.','2026-04-28 13:22:50','2026-04-28 13:22:50',39),(41,'The Black Body as Souvenir in American Lynching','Social Justice',2005,16.00,3,'Lynching, a phenomenon of extra-juridical violence used as a tool of social control, continues to be a lesser acknowledged practice in American history.

The nation signified in the latter term oppresses people based on the former term. Gomez makes a case for black intellectuals in the field of African American studies to more thoughtfully engage a larger diasporic approach with their work. Because the study of black people in America is a diasporic project about dispersal, loss, and community building, Gomez\'s call for African American studies to take the diasporic turn seriously continues to influence the field.','2026-04-28 13:22:50','2026-04-28 13:22:50',41),(43,'Like I Was a Man: Chain Gangs, Gender, and Domestic Carceral Sphere in Jim Crow Georgia','Social Justice',2013,15.95,9,'Sarah Haley argues that the prison industrial complex has been an important site in which racialized conceptions of gender have been consolidated. Focusing on a comprehensive and historic prison reform act passed in Georgia in 1908 that forced imprisoned black women onto chain gangs and introduced a system of parole that compelled black women released from prison to become domestic servants in white homes, Haley argues that these reforms illustrate how black women were stripped of their gender. Incarcerated black women were obligated to perform both domestic labor that was gendered as female and hard physical labor that was gendered as male, but also, as a result of this un-gendering, they were legislated out of the category of the human.','2026-04-28 13:22:50','2026-04-28 13:22:50',42),(44,'How Black Nationalism Became Sui Generis','Social Justice',2012,16.00,2,'Daryl Michael Scott\'s exploration of the vicissitudes of black nationalism that developed over the course of the early and mid-twentieth century negotiates a tension between black nationalism and other forms of nationalism. While nationalism on its own may be problematic, black nationalism has described everything from black separatism and sovereignty to an imperium in imperio in which black people could self-determine without founding a new nation to a generic notion of racial solidarity among black people in a Pan-African context.

As she argues, whiteness became valuable when white people could not be reduced to property under slavery. Given this, it is not only the cultural legacy of enslavement that has kept black people oppressed in the United States, but also a legal system that has continued to treat whiteness as the norm. That system actively excludes people of color from the purview of equal rights and protections while also affording economic benefits exclusively or disproportionately to white Americans.','2026-04-28 13:22:50','2026-04-28 13:22:50',44),(46,'Dune','Fantasy',1965,49.95,8,'Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the spice melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness.
